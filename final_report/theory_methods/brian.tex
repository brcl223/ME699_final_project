\subsection*{The Kalman Filter}
The Kalman Filter is used to mitigate the noise present in a system as the system moves.  The goal is to know what the robot is doing at the next time step, using the knowledge of the current time step.  The motion of the system is described by the following uncertainty model:
\begin{equation}
    x_{t=1}=Ax_t+Bu_t+v_t,
\end{equation}
where $v_t$ is a Gaussian noise variable pertaining to the uncertainty in the system behavior.
\\
The measurement made by the camera follows the uncertainty model
\begin{equation}
    y_t=Cx_t+w_t,
\end{equation}
where $w_t$ is a Gaussian noise variable describing the uncertainty in the camera's mapping of the environment.
\\
The Kalman Filter proceeds with a motion update that represents the motion of the model with noise:
\begin{equation}
    \mu_t^{pred}=A\mu_t+Bu_t
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_t^{pred}=A\Sigma_tA^T+R_v
\end{equation}
\\
After completing the motion, the camera makes a measurement update:
\begin{equation}
    K_t=\Sigma_t^{pred}C^{T}(C\Sigma_t^{pred}C^{T}+R_w)^{-1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{t+1}=\mu_t^{pred}+K(y_t-C\mu_t^{pred})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Sigma_{t+1}=(I-KC)\Sigma_t^{pred}
\end{equation}
\subsection*{Implementation}
Since the camera is attached to the end-effector, the measurements from the camera are made from the frame of the end-effector.  Since the system explores $\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$, the Kalman Filter is created to handle three-dimensional space, ignoring orientations.  So, the robot $r$ and any landmark $L$ $\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times3}$.  The state is therefore a vector consisting of the robot and landmark x-y-z coordinates:
\begin{equation}
    x=\begin{bmatrix} x_r\\y_r\\z_r\\...\\L_{xi}\\L_{yi}\\L_{zi} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
for i landmarks.
\\
Matrices A and B contain only non-zero elements on the main diagonal with entries of 1.  Matrix A has size $(3+3i)x(3+3i)$ and Matrix B is of size $(3+3i)x3$.  The matrix C describes the measurement as the distance between the landmark and the robot.  C is of size $(3i)x(3i+3)$.  The non-zero entries lie on the diagonals, with -1 entered on the corresponding robot state and 1 entered on the corresponding landmark state.
