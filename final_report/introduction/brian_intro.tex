\section{Perception and Planning}
\subsection{Uncertainty in Configurations and Perception}
At the end-effector of our robot there is a camera.  This camera will be able to perceive the obstacles and the movable object in the space.  How the camera generates this data is not a concern of this project, so all the measurements being taken are implied to be from the camera.  The camera will sense where the objects are, and thus generate a collision free path to that object.  The error in the position of the end-effector can be a result of multiple sources: uncertainty in the camera's measurements and uncertainty in the joint configurations.  A Kalman Filter will be implemented into our robot to help take care of the noise present in the system.  As the Kalman Filter proceeds, the state becomes closer to the true state.  While the Kalman filter works, the outputs will be fed into the controls of the robot to generate the desired behavior.
