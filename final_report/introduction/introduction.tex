\section{Introduction}
\subsection*{Objective}
The objective of our project was to take a 3 degree of freedom (DOF) robot manipulator and move an object of unknown mass from an initial state to a specified goal state, and then return the manipulator to its original position.
Three primary methods were experimented with in this project.
The first involved developing a method to estimate the mass matrix of the manipulator, with which a controller was designed to track the arm to the initial state, and back home when the object had been dropped in the goal state.
The second part involved using a Kalman filter to estimate the positions of the initial state, goal state, and the current joint configurations of the manipulator.
The last part was developing an adaptive controller to account for the unknown mass of the object to move it successfully from the initial state to the goal state.

\subsubsection*{Ancillary Tasks}
While not the focus of our project, several other components were required in order to complete the described task.
These include the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Path planning algorithm (RRT*)
  \item Trajectory planner
  \item Collision detection
  \item Inverse kinematics to map Cartesian space target into joint space
\end{itemize}

\noindent These items are mentioned here for completeness sake, but are not discussed in details in the report as they were not the primary objective.
