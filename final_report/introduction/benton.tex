\subsection*{Mass Matrix Modeling}
Modeling the mass matrix of a robotic manipulator becomes increasingly difficult as the DOF of the system increase.
Our attempt to avoid this complexity was to model the mass matrix with a neural network.
To further decrease the dimensionality of the problem, it is well understood that the mass matrix is a positive definite (PD) square matrix.
Thus the neural network output only the lower triangle of the matrix, and the remaining values were copied from the output accordingly.
Once the mass matrix neural network was trained, it was used in simulation to develop a trajectory tracking controller.
