\subsection*{Control Implementation}
The biggest challenge associated with the control model was the derivation of the system regressor function. Thanks to models found in \autocite{lewis2003robot}, this step was alleviated and also allowed us to compare the system response to provided examples. While this type of control model is favorable when parameters are unknown, application of this model in areas such as the automotive industry is not always necessary. It is common practice to use robotic manipulators in spot welding, and material handling applications where the properties such as the mass are known ahead of time. In cases like this, an adaptive model is not necessary and other models may be used. However in applications such as aircraft controls, there are several properties that are both unknown, and subject to external conditions. In these applications, and adaptive model would excel.
