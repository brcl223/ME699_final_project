\subsection*{Mass Matrix Modeling}
While we could not simulate the robot in a frictional environment, the results from our learned mass matrix were quite promising.
It should be noted that while there was no friction involved, the system was still simulated to acquire the acceleration values to test against.
Even though small errors were present in the findings, the controller using the estimated mass matrix still performed quite competitively compared to those with accurate knowledge of the mass matrix.
It will be interesting to see if this approach is possible on a real robot system with various levels of friction.

\subsection*{Kalman Filter}
The Kalman filter in the experiments worked quite well.
Even with fairly high variance in the sampled noise, the filter seemed to converge decently, with better results when the additional mass was not present.
Given longer trajectories, it would be expected that these values could have dropped even lower, which is a good sign that the Kalman filter is effectively reducing the noise from the given samples.
