\subsection{Uncertainty in Configurations}
After developing the model of mass approximation, the entirety of the robot model URDF will be created. The robot configuration $q_1$, $q_2$, ..., $q_n$ determines how the robot will interact with the task space using the end-effector.  The performance of the robot is usually modelled using the pure values of the configuration.  In real life, many variables can
