\section{Project Outline}
For our project, we are proposing three primary phases:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modeling
  \item Perception and Path Trajectory
  \item Control
\end{itemize}

\noindent Each phase of the project will feed into the next.
For instance, the model designed in the robotic modeling section will then be
used in the control section of the project.
By the end of the project, our goal is to have a fully modeled, controlled
robotic manipulator capable of following a simple trajectory and moving to
desired target locations in task space to accomplish simple goals.

\section{Experiments}
All experiments will be done in Julia using the standard packages designed to
both simulate and visualize robotic manipulators.
Our initial goals aim to use a simpler, low degree of freedom (DOF) system to
test our ideas out on, and if successful, the end goal will be to move to the
Panda 7DOF system provided in class.
Experimental results will be included in graphical form, and if time permits,
visualizations will also be made available demonstrating the different aspects
of our project in action.

\section{Team Contributions}
For the individual sections of the project, Benton will focus on the robotic
modeling, Ethan on the robotic controls, and Brian on the perception and
tracking.
However, since each part of the project will slowly feed into one another, each
team member will help contribute to all three parts of the project equally.
